# Lazy, The Double Edged Sword Mentality  
  
"Malas pangkal bodoh, rajin pangkal pandai" said multiple times by my parents, although it is correct in almost every single situation, its not well suited for some cases.  

Let me tell you why...  

Suppose you are in a condition where you need to download bunch of files, copy them to another disk, rename by following certain naming convention, and then recap all those files in a single csv file, lets call this `the boring task`. Well you absolutely can do this manually by repeating every single of those steps for every single time, and in this case congratulations for you to have become such a dilligent human being.  

### But, being dilligent is not always the solution to a problem

Lets think about it this way, suppose `the boring task` that i've told you before is your day-to-day job and that you will be given 10 usd/task that you have done, will you still want to be a dilligent human being by doing it manually again anymore ?  

Well, i think everyone (at least those who code) know the answer, **just be lazy** and write a script, automate every single step, and boom, ez money.  

Okay okay, i sure know this is just such a classical *just be lazy* kind of stuff for those who code, but is this kind of thing actually could be implemented in real life ?

Dont be surprised because the answer is stil yes, and for one more time, let me tell you why...

I think most people would have come across a situation in their life where 

### Main takeaway

Please, im begging you to just talk directly on point when you need something to be spoken, also always see the situation and place when you want to talk about something.

Remember, always talk something in the right time in the right place, and **be polite no matter what**.
