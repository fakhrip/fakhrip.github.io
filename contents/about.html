Hi hi, you can see my fullname up above and as you can already see, i usually go by <code>f4r4w4y</code> as my online presence (even though <b>that doesnt always mean that f4r4w4y == me</b>).


I graduated in 2022 with my bachelor's degree in <code>electrical engineering</code>, although i dont really care that much about degree since i mostly learn things by myself back in those days, but i have to say that college did help me to know about lots of possible options/paths to choose from.


Career wise, im currently a senior software engineer at <a class="single" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pi-xcels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pi-xcels</a> helping them build a seamless digital receipt system by utilizing my abilities and knowledge in both <code>fullstack</code> and <code>IoT</code> development while also do <code>security</code> related stuff here and there.


As a life hobby, im also a community mentor at <a class="single" href="https://github.com/Daskom-Lab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daskom Laboratory</a> since 2020 where i guided new laboratory members to learn about software development from knowing absolutely nothing about it up to where they can land their first job, like <a class="single" href="https://adhimf.my.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these</a> <a class="single" href="https://alifsiregar.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two</a> gentlemen for example.


My love in technology comes from back when i was a kid, i always loved robots, RC cars, and everything that comes with it, and that is when my curiosity start to sparks and grows even bigger as i grow older.


In my spare time, i love solving <code>CTF</code> challenges and playing around with electronics like an <code>FPGA</code> and whatnot.
