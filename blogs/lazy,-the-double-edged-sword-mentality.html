                <h1>Lazy, The Double Edged Sword Mentality</h1>

<p>"Malas pangkal bodoh, rajin pangkal pandai" said multiple times by my parents, although it is correct in almost every single situation, its not well suited for some cases.  </p>

<p>Let me tell you why...  </p>

<p>Suppose you are in a condition where you need to download bunch of files, copy them to another disk, rename by following certain naming convention, and then recap all those files in a single csv file, lets call this <code>the boring task</code>. Well you absolutely can do this manually by repeating every single of those steps for every single time, and in this case congratulations for you to have become such a dilligent human being.  </p>

<h3>But, being dilligent is not always the solution to a problem</h3>

<p>Lets think about it this way, suppose <code>the boring task</code> that i've told you before is your day-to-day job and that you will be given 10 usd/task that you have done, will you still want to be a dilligent human being by doing it manually again anymore ?  </p>

<p>Well, i think everyone (at least those who code) know the answer, <strong>just be lazy</strong> and write a script, automate every single step, and boom, ez money.  </p>

<p>Okay okay, i sure know this is just such a classical <em>just be lazy</em> kind of stuff for those who code, but is this kind of thing actually could be implemented in real life ?</p>

<p>Dont be surprised because the answer is still yes, and for one more time, let me tell you why...</p>

<p>I think most people (unless you are crazy rich since you were born) would have come across a situation in their life where they need to make some money for their living and thus dilligently working all the time to survive this life.</p>

<p>You can do that, however there are lot more choices than you might already think :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Dont care about money and just blatantly living this life however you like it (be free like a tarzan XD).</p></li>
<li><p>Dont be stupid by thinking that being dilligent all the time is the only way, calculate how much money you think is safe for your future, and for how many years you will have to be dilligent enough to catch that target, and thats it, you can live your life in laziness for the rest of your time. </p></li>
<li><p>Just cheat it, alright this might be the dumbest and silliest idea, but think about it, you can just become a beggar in one big and developed country and then move to the lower and developing country and boom you got more money than you think to actually make some business in the country that you've just moved in and make even more money out of it, easy right ? (<strong>but dont do this stupid crappy solution</strong>, unless you are not smart enough to think about other solution, use your brain people).</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Hell in the other edge of the sword</h3>

<p><strong>Yes you have to be dilligent</strong>, i kind of giving up to my own statement, but no, <strong>not for all the time being</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="../pictures/site10/thanos.gif" alt="thanos" /></p>

<p>Being dilligent in one side is a must to keep it balanced, as all things should be, just like thanos said, but not in every side of the coin, if you've seen <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_dan_Yang">yin-yang concept</a> which in most cases you have, you should know and understand that it means you have to be dilligent at one point and then could just be lazy at another.</p>

<p>In order for you to achieve the absolute laziness and by that i mean just enjoying this life and live in happiness with your loved ones without doing any work whatsoever, well you can, but you have to be in absolute dilligentness beforehand, just like the famous proverb in indonesia that says "Berakit-rakit ke hulu, berenang-renang ke tepian. Bersakit-sakit dahulu, bersenang-senang kemudian.".</p>

<p>Just like in <code>the boring task</code> part, you have to be dilligent in the first place in order for you to be able to script and make an automation for that particular task, and just like that, you can be lazy afterward.</p>

<p>If you in one ocassion dont appreciate the value of time, you will be rushed by the short space of time you get left, and <strong>laziness is much like time, use it wisely</strong>.</p>

<h3>The tale of <code>gabut</code></h3>

<p>I honestly never understand the reason why people (at least in my home country) keep saying this word without knowing what it actually means, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaji_buta">wikipedia</a> says that <code>gabut</code> is the abbreviation of <code>gaji buta</code> that means a salary received by a person that didnt do some if not all of their job.</p>

<p><strong>Its stupid, i know...</strong></p>

<p>This is not even laziness, its worse than that, its like being a beggar that force people to give their money. The fact that this <code>gabut</code> term are not even just being used in this kind of situation, its actually almost all the time being used when a person doesnt know what to do and they just dont have any idea about what they have to do either.</p>

<p>People are getting even more arrogant these days, they think that they dont have anything to do again anymore and thus calling themself <code>gabut</code> for some reason.</p>

<p>Like, cmon people how many things that you have actually accomplished that gives you the ability to say that you are <code>gabut</code> anyway ? </p>

<p><img src="../pictures/site10/confuse.gif" alt="confuse" /></p>

<h3>Main takeaway</h3>

<p>If you want to be success in this life, dont be lazy, at least not for everytime, and you have to work really hard and be dilligent, but also not for everytime.</p>

<p>Good luck everyone and control the sword, dont let it controls you.</p>
