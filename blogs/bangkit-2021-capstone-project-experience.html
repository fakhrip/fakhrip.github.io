                <h1>Bangkit 2021 Capstone Project Experience</h1>

<p>I was too lazy to just get into university class and learn almost about the same thing over and over again and having to lose my coding time because im majoring in electrical engineering (also, im bad at math XD) and there are only small amount of coding related lectures and/or projects in my major (for at least in my university).  </p>

<p>Luckily, on exactly 19 November 2020 my academic advisor (dosen wali) gave an information regarding Google Bangkit 2021 and i was so excited at the moment and just directly set on a plan to take this journey (actually for escaping from my university class) and for one more time, i can focus on coding related stuff again and do some practical things rather than staring on a whiteboard full of theoritical stuff (and math).</p>

<p>And now that i already joined bangkit for around 5-6 months, there are lots of journey (and qwiklabs) that i have gone through, especially the Capstone Project, that is actually something that im going after in this bangkit event.  </p>

<p>Without further ado, here is my experience and my takes regarding Bangkit 2021 Capstone Project, also maybe there will be some lessons to learn for all of us.  </p>

<h3>Team Recruitment</h3>

<p>Starting with the first and the most chaotic things that happened when the Capstone Project finally announced in the bangkit discord server, some people are trying to make up a team that full of highly skilled people, some are trying to join this "full of highly skilled people" team, others are even just giving up in their destiny and let the gacha (randomized team) system do the work for them.</p>

<p>In this part, alhamdulillah i was so grateful that i ended up having a team that are consisting of highly skilled people (even tho one of my teammates actualy leave this project for some reason, i can't even contact this person ever since we have registered our team :v), so there are only 5 of us and we were totally okay with that.  </p>

<p>These are short descriptions about them :</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>A. One from cloud learning path that have done several freelance 
   project in machine learning
B. One from android learning path that have learned about web development 
   and also have done a project in it
C. One from android learning path that actually already have experience working 
   in android development for 2 years
D. Last one comes from a machine learning path that have a big brain about 
   idea brainstorming and documentation stuff
</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Update:</strong> they gave me permission and want me to mention them, so here you go, A is <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zaza-ipynb">@ihza</a>, B is <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/alifsiregar">@alif</a>, C is <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ianfyan">@fyan</a>, D is <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Triskarum01">@triska</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Question is, how can i even get a team like that ?</p>

<p>I was actually only have 3 person including myself in the team (the A and B, both are my university friends), but i start opening a recruitment and people start to message me about themselves and what kind of project they have done in the past (basically their cv) and that is where i got C and D from.</p>

<p>This is actually the part where i hate the most because i have to reject people and its the hardest thing to do for me until this time, but also i learned a lot from rejecting people and how it actually feels like being a recruiter in a company, the only difference is the quantity, i can say that i only have 1:10 amount of people that trying to be recruited compared to a company or even startups.</p>

<p><strong>From this i learned the importance of portfolio</strong> whether its in the form of a project or even a certificate, so always remember to make a good portfolio (update your <code>github</code> with all projects you've created and also put up a good resume somewhere either in your website/cv/linkedin).</p>

<p>And also there is a reason why <strong>social networking is important</strong>, because that is how i know A and B (my university friends) and make up a team with them.</p>

<h3>Project Management</h3>

<p>Everytime you want to start doing a project with a team, the first problem you will face is how you want to manage your team and the project itself so everything (development up to production stage) will run smoothly in the process.</p>

<p>I will tear this discussion in to two parts, first in a perspective of a leader, and second as a member :</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Leader</strong></p>

<p>As a leader, you would want to be able to make a fast and correct decision regarding the whole thing in your project because you are the main key in every decision making and all of your members will automatically follow whatever decisions you made (of course in conjunction with all member's decisions too).  </p>

<p>So the first thing that you have to do (based on my experience) is that you have to make a good planning at least in your mind about how many times this project will take place and also how are you going to manage it during the process and making sure all your members are doing fine with their progress while keeping yourself going well with your own progress.</p>

<p>And as a programmer, i think the most important thing to do is first <strong>create an automation system for everything</strong>, really, everything (this is actually not hard as there are already bunch of productive tools that you can use to create the automation).</p>

<p>These are automations that i didn't create at the time i manage the capstone project but i think will be a good idea to build :</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">-</span> Schedule reminder system  
<span class="k">-</span> Automated project timeline that connected with the remote repository 
  that your team are working on (i did create a project timeline but i didnt find the time to automate it)
</code></pre></div>

<p>And here is automation that i have created to manage my team capstone project :</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">-</span> Automated github pull request and issue tracker that connected with our discord server
<span class="k">-</span> All build pipelines alerting also connected with our discord server
</code></pre></div>

<p>Although these automations are not necessary to build but its absolutely useful as you can focus with your progress while letting the system work with the house keeping stuff.</p>

<p>But you still have to always <strong>remind your peers regarding their progress</strong> and what they should have done, because thats what i think a good leader is, and in this case you also work as a project manager and thats what a project manager do. </p>

<p>Also you have to <strong>be very kind and patient to each and every member in your team</strong>, managing project is hard, managing people is harder, but remember, managing problem that comes because the lack of teamwork is the hardest one, so always avoid having a bad work environment in your team by being kind and respectful to one and another.</p>

<p>In case of something bad happened in your team, you have to make a decision and be able to put the fire down real quick, if the problem is regarding member's attitude, try to have a 1 on 1 session with them and talk about the problem they're facing, but if the problem is about the fact that your member just don't care about the project, honestly i dont know the solution myself but i think i will just try to cover their progress together with the rest of the team members and share the burden across all of us.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Member</strong></p>

<p>And for a member, the most important thing that you have to do is to <strong>answer and reply to every single chat that is sent by your leader</strong>, because you have to understand how frustrating it already is to manage a project and how you are making your leader become more frustrated when you don't answer their chat.</p>

<p>You actually have to be grateful to become a member as you dont have to manage the whole project and keep in touch with other people progress, but remember, <strong>communication is an important thing to do</strong> when doing a project, because once you got a miss communication, you will be facing with a lot bigger problems afterward (the existence of a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/176754/what-do-we-call-a-person-who-blames-others-for-things-they-didnt-do#:~:text=scapegoat%20(noun)%20A%20person%20who,scapegoat%20of%20something%20or%20somebody">Scapegoat and a Scapegoater</a>), so you do always have to stay in contact with all the team members.</p>

<p>Last but not least is that you always have to be <strong>self disciplined with your own progress</strong> because that would make project manager's job a lot easier and will also give your peers spirits to make the project successful either in development stage or production stage.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For managing the social stuff (communication, etc) you have to decide what social media app (discord / telegram / slack) that you want to use because each have different perks and benefits over the others.</p>

<p>Good thing is that there are no problems that happened in my team regarding the work environment and stuff, <strong>but</strong> we actually face something different, <strong>i got positive for covid</strong> in about two weeks before the deadline (and i starting to doubt if the project will be finished on time or not), i didnt know the solution back then so what i did is just try to recover from covid as fast as possible and get back to work, and thats exactly what happened, also im very grateful that the bangkit team extended the deadline because if not, then everything that i have done for my project will go to waste just because of covid XD.</p>

<p>Another problem start to raise with the fact that <strong>the android developer in my team also got positive for covid</strong> right in 3 days before the deadline, and we didn't manage to find any solution to this as i have just recovered from covid back then and i have to catch up with my progress, that is why our android application are still lacking so many features and there are even stock photos that we have not changed :v.</p>

<h3>Tech Stack</h3>

<p>Alright, we're done with project management, so the next thing we have to think about is the tech stack for the whole project (<code>android</code>, <code>web</code>, <code>cloud</code>, <code>machine learning</code>, <code>backend</code>, <code>embedded system</code>, etc).</p>

<p>It all comes down to system design but dont get me wrong, for an <code>MVP</code>, no matter what kind of system design that you are using actually have nothing to do with the successfulness of a project as people and end users will not see the inside and rather than that they will just see the frontmatters of your project, so just dont overthink about tech stack in early stage of a <code>startup-like</code> project like this.</p>

<p>In my team, we're just using tech stacks that all of our team members are already capable of doing, so we are just focusing on finishing the development stage first without thinking hard about the tech stacks.</p>

<p>And for a little bit of a tips, rather than writing boilerplate crud code for the backend, you can just use <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine">Hasura GraphQL Engine</a> and let the engine automatically serve a <code>graphql endpoint</code> that you can just automatically query based on the data structure that you have set on your database and each table (this is also the thing that we are using for our backend), for more detail on their website at <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://hasura.io/">https://hasura.io/</a> (please keep in mind that this is not a promotion or something).</p>

<hr />

<p>So that is my experience on the capstone project, i think everything will be able to be better if we can do it in offline mode so everyone can gather in the same place working on the same project and i think it will just be an awesome thing to do.</p>

<p>Also this is actually my first experience on having a team that are able to do something based on their own skills and experience and have their own skillsets in doing something, so its actually a lot easier for me to give some instructions and guidance about what they have to do and when to do it, <strong>thank you so much for the bangkit team for giving me an opportunity to work on a project like this</strong>.</p>

<p>Anyway you can check my team capstone project in <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/B21-CAP0236">this link</a> if you're wondering, i can probably say that we are only 90% finished with this project, and as you can also probably see that even the web build is failing in netlify :v (but its actually working in local build), and there are other problems as mentioned before, and what i want to say is that :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even if you have planned for something good, there will always be unexpected problems (such as covid and others), and its okay to fail, because there will always be something to learn out of it 👍🏿.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Last word</h3>

<p>Thanks for reading, i hope this article is and/or will be usefull for all of you, and im truly sorry if there are some of bad or inappropriate words in this article, i never meant it 🙏.</p>

<p>Also thanks to Allah SWT that have gave me time to write this and all this wonderful experience in my life.</p>

<p>And congratulations to all bangkit students friends for finishing your capstone project despite of having so many problems in the process, good luck on your next journey everyone !!!.</p>
