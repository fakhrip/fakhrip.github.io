                <h1>Bangkit 2021 Capstone Project Experience</h1>

<p>I was too lazy to just get into university class and learn almost about the same thing over and over again and having to lose my coding time because im majoring in electrical engineering (also, im bad at math XD) and there are only small amount of coding related lectures and/or projects in my major (for at least in my university).  </p>

<p>Luckily, on exactly 19 November 2020 my academic advisor (dosen wali) gave an information regarding Google Bangkit 2021 and i was so excited at the moment and just directly set on a plan to take this journey (actually for escaping from my university class) and for one more time, i can focus on coding related stuff again and do some practical things rather than staring on a whiteboard full of theoritical stuff (and math).</p>

<p>And now that i already joined bangkit for around 5-6 months, there are lots of journey (and qwiklabs) that i have gone through, especially the Capstone Project, that is actually something that im going after in this bangkit event.  </p>

<p>Without further ado, here is my experience and my takes regarding Bangkit 2021 Capstone Project, also maybe there will be some lessons to learn for all of us.  </p>

<h3>Team Recruitment</h3>

<p>Starting with the first and the most chaotic things that happened when the Capstone Project finally announced in the bangkit discord server, some people are trying to make up a team that full of highly skilled people, some are trying to join this "full of highly skilled people" team, others are even just giving up in their destiny and let the gacha (randomized team) system do the work for them.</p>

<p>In this part, alhamdulillah i was so grateful that i ended up having a team that are consisting of highly skilled people (even tho one of my teammates actualy leave this project for some reason, i can't even contact this person ever since we have registered our team :v), so there are only 5 of us and we were totally okay with that.  </p>

<p>These are short descriptions about them :</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>A. One from cloud learning path that have done several freelance project in machine learning
B. One from android learning path that have learned about web development and also have done a project in it
C. One from android learning path that actually already have experience working in android development for 2 years
D. Last one comes from a machine learning path that have a big brain about idea brainstorming and documentation stuff
</code></pre></div>

<p>Question is, how can i even get a team like that ?</p>

<p>I was actually only have 3 person including myself in the team (the A and B, both are my university friends), but i start opening a recruitment and people start to message me about themselves and what kind of project they have done in the past (basically their cv) and that is where i got C and D from.</p>

<p>This is actually the part where i hate the most because i have to reject people and its the hardest thing to do for me until this time, but also i learned a lot from rejecting people and how it actually feels like being a recruiter in a company, the only difference is the quantity, i can say that i only have 1:10 amount of people that trying to be recruited compared to a company or even startups.</p>

<p><strong>From this i learned the importance of portfolio</strong> whether its in the form of a project or even a certificate, so always remember to make a good portfolio (so update your <code>github</code> with all projects you've created and also put up a good resume somewhere either in your website/cv/linkedin).</p>

<p>And also there is a reason why <strong>social networking is important</strong>, because that is how i know A and B (my university friends) and make up a team with them.</p>

<h3>Project Management</h3>

<p>Everytime you want to start doing a project with a team, the first problem you will face is how you want to manage your team and the project itself so everything (development up to production stage) will run smoothly in the process.</p>

<p>I will tear this discussion in to two parts, first in a perspective of a leader, and second as a member :</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Leader</strong></p>

<p>As a leader, you would want to be able to make a fast and correct decision regarding the whole thing in your project because you are the main key in every decision making and all of your members will automatically follow whatever decisions you made (of course in conjunction with all member's decisions too).  </p>

<p>So the first thing that you have to do (based on my experience) is that you have to make a good planning at least in your mind about how many times this project will take place and also how are you going to manage it during the process and making sure all your members are doing fine with their progress while keeping yourself going well with your own progress.</p>

<p>And as a programmer, i think the most important thing to do is first <strong>create an automation system for everything</strong>, really, everything (this is actually not hard as there are already bunch of productive tools that you can use to create the automation).</p>

<p>These are automations that i didn't create at the time i manage the capstone project but i think will be a good idea to build :</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">-</span> Schedule reminder system  
<span class="k">-</span> Automated project timeline that connected with the remote repository 
  that your team are working on (i did create a project timeline but i didnt find the time to automate it)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Although these automations are not necessary to build but its absolutely useful as you can focus with your progress while letting the system work with the house keeping stuff.</p>

<p>But you still have to always remind your peers regarding their progress and what they should have done, because thats what i think a good leader is, and in this case you also work as a project manager and thats what a project manager do. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Member</strong></p>

<p>And for a member, the most important thing that you have to do is to <strong>answer and reply to every single chat that is sent by your leader</strong>, because you have to understand how frustrating it already is to manage a project and how you are making your leader become more frustrated when you don't answer their chat.</p>

<p>You actually have to be grateful to become a member as you dont have to manage the whole project and keep in touch with other people progress, but remember, <strong>communication is an important thing to do</strong> when doing a project, because once you got a miss communication, you will be facing with a lot bigger problems afterward (the existance of a <a target="_blank" href="https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/176754/what-do-we-call-a-person-who-blames-others-for-things-they-didnt-do#:~:text=scapegoat%20(noun)%20A%20person%20who,scapegoat%20of%20something%20or%20somebody">Scapegoat and a Scapegoater</a>).</p>

<p>Last but not least is that you always have to be <strong>self disciplined with your own progress</strong> because that would make project manager's job a lot easier and will also give your peers spirits to make the project successful either in development stage or production stage.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Conversation is an exchange of information</h3>

<p>Firstly, information is a message or symbol or anything that has a meaning of a data to be sent to the target, and we are exchanging lot of informations in a conversation. There are useless one and useful one. By saying that i don't like chit-chatting means that i don't like to receive such a useless data that i don't even know whats the purpose of the data thats given to me ?!?!.</p>

<p>Most people in most of the time always think that chit-chat is a way to start a conversation, just like the same way a TCP send SYN and ACK in the first place to make sure the connection established succesfully <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/know-how/introduction-to-tcp/">more on this here</a>. But cmon we are not a machine that has to do something like that, arent we ?.</p>

<p>There are many ways to start a conversation in some sort and it doesn't have to be a chit-chat type of stuff.</p>

<h3>So, what is nice info ?</h3>

<p>Basically this is the answer that i love the most to stop a chit-chat and to kind of politely saying "stop chit-chatting dude, i hate it". For me, its the best answer i can find so far as this one will not create any kind of awkward situation whatsoever. Let me show you some example of that.</p>

<hr />

<p>A: "Hey man, do you know that a (put any food/drinking water here) is really delicious and that you can only buy it from (put any fancy store that only has that fancy food)"  </p>

<p>[Most of the time, i know that this person is trying to approach me in some sort and the main reason for that is because this person just want me to help him/her in their problem].  </p>

<p>Me: "Hmm, nice info"</p>

<p>[See, its really efficient, isn't it ?. And moreover i can continue the conversation with a striking question if you will].</p>

<p>Me: "So, are there anything i can help ?"</p>

<p>A: (Will start talking to the "main part" of the conversation or as what i say "the real conversation")</p>

<hr />

<p>I mean chit-chatting is usually be a nice info, but not possibly usefull at all. and also <strong>nice doesn't have to be usefull right</strong> 😉.</p>

<h3>Last word</h3>

<p>Thanks for reading, i hope this article is and/or will be usefull for all of you, and im truly sorry if there are some of bad or inappropriate words in this article, i never meant it 🙏.</p>

<p>Also thanks to Allah SWT that have gave me time to write this and all this wonderful experience in my life.</p>
