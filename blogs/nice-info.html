                <h1>Nice Info</h1>

<p>One of the main reason why i dont like talking to most people is that there always be some chit-chatting involved throughout the conversation, and <strong>i absolutely hate chit-chatting</strong>, maybe most of people will just be confused about me or other people that hate chit-chatting, but seriously, this is something useless that we have to do in the society with a reason i dont know.  </p>

<p>So, let me tell you why chit-chatting is always be a really useless activity, and what is the connection with <em>nice info</em>.</p>

<h3>How useless chit-chatting is...</h3>

<p>There are so many things we can talk and have a conversation about that is just far more useful than chit-chatting, but most of people will never say about something directly on point, and they will oftenly talk about something else that have no connection about what they really want to talk about in the first place.</p>

<p>Talking about family, health condition, life, love is good but not everytime. Just like talking about technology and business when you are actually in a cemetery, there are always be something to talk about in the right time in the right place, and chit-chatting is not one of them, chit-chatting is more like "oh i want to be close to him/her" and so no matter what kind of talk and conversation thats happening will most likely be useless.</p>

<h3>Conversation is an exchange of information</h3>

<p>Firstly, information is a message or symbol or anything that has a meaning of a data to be sent to the target, and we are exchanging lot of informations in a conversation. There are useless one and useful one. By saying that i don't like chit-chatting means that i don't like to receive such a useless data that i don't even know whats the purpose of the data thats given to me ?!?!.</p>

<p>Most people in most of the time always think that chit-chat is a way to start a conversation, just like the same way a TCP send SYN and ACK in the first place to make sure the connection established succesfully <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/know-how/introduction-to-tcp/">more on this here</a>. But cmon we are not a machine that has to do something like that, arent we ?.</p>

<p>There are many ways to start a conversation in some sort and it doesn't have to be a chit-chat type of stuff.</p>

<h3>So, what is nice info ?</h3>

<p>Basically this is the answer that i love the most to stop a chit-chat and to kind of politely saying "stop chit-chatting dude, i hate it". For me, its the best answer i can find so far as this one will not create any kind of awkward situation whatsoever. Let me show you some example of that.</p>

<hr />

<p>A: "Hey man, do you know that a (put any food/drinking water here) is really delicious and that you can only buy it from (put any fancy store that only has that fancy food)"  </p>

<p>[Most of the time, i know that this person is trying to approach me in some sort and the main reason for that is because this person just want me to help him/her in their problem].  </p>

<p>Me: "Hmm, nice info"</p>

<p>[See, its really efficient, isn't it ?. And moreover i can continue the conversation with a striking question if you will].</p>

<p>Me: "So, are there anything i can help ?"</p>

<p>A: (Will start talking to the "main part" of the conversation or as what i say "the real conversation")</p>

<hr />

<p>I mean chit-chatting is usually be a nice info, but not possibly usefull at all. and also <strong>nice doesn't have to be usefull right</strong> üòâ.</p>

<h3>Main takeaway</h3>

<p>Please, im begging you to just talk directly on point when you need something to be spoken, also always see the situation and place when you want to talk about something.</p>

<p>Remember, always talk something in the right time in the right place, and <strong>be polite no matter what</strong>.</p>
